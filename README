This is LEDE fork to build Asus RT-AC58U firmware. It is combined from LEDE trunk and a fork by chunkey
https://github.com/chunkeey/LEDE-IPQ40XX

rt-ac58u.config is a firmware configuration file to build sysupgrade.

To build firmware follow LEDE guides.
This is the buildsystem for the LEDE Linux distribution.

Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to get all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf
and "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks of all of them into
package/feeds/.

Rename rt-ac58u.config to .config
Please use "make menuconfig" to modify this configuration if needed.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python, perl, make,
find, grep, diff, unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers.


Simply running "make" will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.
